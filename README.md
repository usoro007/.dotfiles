My .dotfiles are vim specific and serves as the basis for my Python IDE.

Special thanks to Leeren Chang! He doesn't know me but I wouldn't be able
to use the incredible power of vim without his guidance. He lifted the 
veil to show how things work. 

More broadly, I must give thanks to Mike Levin! His work not only raised
my awareness of the short stack (Linux, Python, vim, and git) but also
gave me a mechanism to get my feet wet.
